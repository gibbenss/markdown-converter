# markdown-converter
An Excel VBA programme that converts markdown to native formatting.

**note: this is a specific markdown style utilised by a colleague**

Text between asterixes become italicised

i.e. * italics * becomes *italics*
  
Text between tilds (\~) becomes underlined
                            
Text between open curly brackets becomes boldened

i.e. {bold{ becomes **bold**

If there is an uneven number of a markdown symbol present (e.g. three asterixes), then the cell is shaded red to notify the user that it needs to be checked.

To use, select the range of cells to be converted, and then run the macro.
